# What is routing!

Routing is a term that means to go from one link to another or from one page to another. To perform routing we use **routes** that helps us to navigate a page.

## What are routes 

Routes are path in the URL like www.example.com/signin is the url and after the single slash there is written "**signin**" which signifies the path or route to the signin page.

We can add multiple routes or nested routes like
www.example.com/signin/reset-password this signifies a route **inside** signin page
www.example.com/logout this signifies a **logout route**
